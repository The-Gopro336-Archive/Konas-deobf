Konas client deobfuscated. <br>
Creds: Cattyn/PlutoSolutions for the dump to deobf jar. <br>
Didn't deobf com/konasclient/loader directory cause lets be honest we only here for me/darki/konas directory lol <br>
Also didn't bother to check if the src from CFR 0.151 is good so if its bad ill use fernflower <br>
